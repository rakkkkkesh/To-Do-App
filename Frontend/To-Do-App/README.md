# To-Do App

A simple, interactive To-Do list application built with React. This app allows users to add, edit, remove, and mark tasks as complete. The tasks are stored locally using `localStorage`, so they persist across page reloads.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks to the list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Edit the text of an existing task.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Mark tasks as completed, which applies a strike-through style.
- **Remove Tasks**: Delete tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are stored in `localStorage` and persist even after page reloads.
## Usage
Once the app is running:

Add Tasks: Type your task in the input field and click "Add" to add it to the list.
Edit Tasks: Click the edit icon next to a task to modify it. Save your changes by clicking "Save."
Complete Tasks: Click the circle next to the task to mark it as completed.
Delete Tasks: Click the trash icon next to a task to remove it from the list.
The tasks are saved in localStorage, so your data is retained between page reloads.

## Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
